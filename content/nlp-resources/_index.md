# Overview

To help democratize Indonesian Artificial Intelligence, we aim to compile a list of Open-Source NLP (Natural Language Processing) models and datasets, sourced primarily from the [HuggingFace Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/models). We categorized them into their languages and their specific task.

## Available Languages

- Indonesian (_Bahasa Indonesia_)
- Javanese (_Bahasa Jawa_)
- Sundanese (_Bahasa Sunda_)
- Multilingual (_Multibahasa_)
